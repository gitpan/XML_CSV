Module: XML::CSV

Description:
    XML::CSV provides functions to easily transform CSV documents into XML.  The module uses Text::CSV_XS to
    parse csv files and put into perl data structure.  The perl data structure is then written into xml data
    structure.
    XML::CSV allows to create your own Text::CSV_XS object with defaults that fit your needs or just use defaults.
    I will enhance it's functionality as time permits.  Efficiency is very important in parsing and writting large
    docs so one of the next enhancements will include an option for creating a data structure or write as you parse.
	That will eliminate the need for storing a data structure before writting xml.  The data structure has it's own
	benefits, since it allows you to provide your own structure or modify the existing one before you write to xml.
	Any ideas or requests for enhancements or added functionality are very welcomed, so please feel free to email
	them to me.
